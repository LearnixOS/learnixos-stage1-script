* learnixos-stage1-script
This is a simple stage 1 script. It creates a stage 1 tarball of LearnixOS, great for automation, and for transparency of how I create LearnixOS. Here's what it will do:
+ glibc system (musl option would be a pain in the ass)
+ custom shell and init system
+ uses eudev instead of udev
+ among many more ideas, however as this is the stage1 (meaning that it should be minimal), this will NOT have the package manager yet nor any utilities that require a lot of deps

** Using this script
To use this script, just run the script and it'll compile a whole tarball for you. This will create a root directory in the git repo. 
You are required to have all compilation tools.
#+begin_src shell
    ./build-learnixos.sh
#+end_src
** Credits:
+ Kudos to LFS, literally the ONLY resource I'm using to create the scripts.
