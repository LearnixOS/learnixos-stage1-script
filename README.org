* learnixos-stage1-script
This is a simple stage 1 script. It creates a stage 1 tarball of LearnixOS, great for automation, and for transparency of how I create LearnixOS. Here's what it will do:
+ glibc system (musl option would be a pain in the ass)
+ options for a fully systemd system and sysvinit (this is just for now, I'm working on seeing if I should make my own init systme or create a frontend for sinit)
+ and much more to come, some ideas that I'm thinking of are options for using udev alternatives like mdevd.

** Using this script
To use the script, I implore you to edit the LFS variable to whatever you desire, this indicates where it will be built. LearnixOS is based off of LFS, so we give credit to the LFS team for the resources we have for making this script.
#+begin_src shell
    ./build-learnixos.sh
#+end_src
** Credits:
+ Kudos to LFS, literally the ONLY resource I'm using to create the scripts.
