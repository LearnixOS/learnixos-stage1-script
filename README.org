* learnixos-stage1-script
This is a simple stage 1 script. It creates a stage 1 tarball of LearnixOS, great for automation, and for transparency of how I create LearnixOS. Here's what it will do:
+ glibc system (musl option would be a pain in the ass)
+ options for a fully systemd system and sysvinit (this is just for now, I'm working on seeing if I should make my own init systme or create a frontend for sinit)
+ and much more to come, some ideas that I'm thinking of are options for using udev alternatives like mdevd.

+ Kudos to LFS, literally the ONLY resource I'm using to create the scripts.
